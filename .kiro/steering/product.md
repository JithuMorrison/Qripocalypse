# QRipocalypse - Product Overview

QRipocalypse is a haunted-themed developer platform that combines project management, code editing, and deployment capabilities with a spooky aesthetic. The platform features a dark, gothic UI with ghost animations and supernatural theming throughout.

## Core Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with client-side password hashing (PBKDF2)
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects with file systems, stored in localStorage
- **Code Editor**: In-browser code editing with syntax highlighting and file management
- **Git Integration**: Simulated Git operations (status, log, diff, commit, push, pull, merge) with project-specific context
- **Deployment System**: Multi-platform deployment simulation (GCP, AWS, Vercel, Render) with Kubernetes configuration
- **Monitoring**: DataDog-style metrics visualization and log management
- **Diff Viewer**: Side-by-side code comparison with LCS-based diff algorithm
- **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Visual merge ritual interface for resolving code conflicts
- **QR Code Tools**: QR code generation and scanning capabilities

## Target Users

Developers who want a fun, themed environment for managing projects, viewing diffs, and simulating deployment workflows. The platform is educational and experimental, using localStorage for all persistence (no backend required).

## Theming

The entire application uses a "haunted" aesthetic with:

- Dark backgrounds with purple/green accents
- Ghost, vampire, zombie, and witch emojis throughout
- Spooky terminology (e.g., "Spirit Realm", "Necro Terminal", "Merge Ritual")
- Creepster font for headings
- Glitch effects and floating ghost animations
